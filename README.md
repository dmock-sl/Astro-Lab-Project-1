# This data and this notebook was created in completion of the second project in an Upper Division / Graduate Level Astronomy lab course at UT Austin. The purpose of this lab was to image a galaxy and a star cluster and determine appromixate ages. For the galaxy, all we were able to determine was that the galaxy was dominated by younger stars. In the case of the star cluster, we used our data to create a Color-Magnitude diagram (CMD) and then used models of star cluster CMDs to determine an approximate age for the star cluster of 6.5 billion years.
